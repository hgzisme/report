### Week 13 Achievements:

#### Challenges:
* Project Assessment: Although the project was completed, my personal assessment is that it lacks polish due to disjointed collaboration among team members.

* Team Management Challenges: I encountered significant difficulties in managing the team during the execution phase:
    * One member showed unclear progress and status, with very limited engagement.
    * One member failed to complete their assigned tasks.
    * Consequently, the team faced numerous obstacles during implementation, resulting in a rudimentary and unrefined final product.
