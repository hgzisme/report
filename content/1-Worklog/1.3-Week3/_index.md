### Week 3 Achievements:

*   **Completed Lab 3, gaining a solid understanding of fundamental networking concepts on AWS:**
    *   Practiced creating and configuring a complete Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
    *   Set up Subnets (public & private), Route Tables, and Security Groups to control traffic flow.
    *   Clearly understood the role of a Network Access Control List (NACL).
    *   Launched EC2 Instances in different subnets and tested the connectivity between them.
    *   Successfully configured a NAT Gateway to allow resources in private subnets to access the internet.

*   **Completed the learning content for Module 3:**
    *   Finished sections 03-01 and 03-02, reinforcing theoretical knowledge.

*   **Expanded knowledge of the Compute service (EC2) and related services:**
    *   Learned about the auto-scaling capabilities of EC2 Auto Scaling.
    *   Understood the concepts and use cases for shared file storage services like EFS and FSx.
    *   Became familiar with Amazon Lightsail as a simple virtual server solution.
    *   Learned about the Application Migration Service for supporting application migration to AWS.

*   **Practiced data backup and recovery with Lab 13:**
    *   Successfully created a backup plan for resources.
    *   Performed a restore process to recover information from a backup.
    *   Understood the process of cleaning up resources after the lab.

*   **Completed Lab 10:**
    *   Regarding Lab 10, I still don't have a clear understanding of it yet, so I plan to redo it a few more times.
