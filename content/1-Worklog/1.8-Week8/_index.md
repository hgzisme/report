### Week 8 Achievements:
*   Started brainstorming ideas for the Final Proposal
*   Researched how to use the services the team will use in the Final proposal
*   Designed the system architecture for the AWS services to be used in the proposal

#### Difficulties:
*   Because we didn't fully understand how to properly design a system architecture, it took us a long time to create the diagram. We also had some difficulties during the brainstorming process.
*   While reviewing for the midterm exam, I didn't know what materials to study from, so I didn't perform well on the exam day.
