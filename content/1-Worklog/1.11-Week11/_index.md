### Week 11 Achievements:
- Completed the FPT University Coursera assignments, preparing for the course exam.
- Learned more about DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and IaC with CloudFormation and AWS CDK.
- Learned about container services like Docker and containers on AWS:
  - ECR, ECS & EKS, App Runner
- Learned about Monitoring & Observability with CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray.

### Challenges:
- The proposal idea faced several challenges regarding operation, high costs, and a complex project scope.
-> We decided to change the proposal topic after considering the difficulties the previous project would have faced.

- Regarding the event, I did not fully understand the Container, Monitoring & Observability services.
-> I plan to do more research on my own to better understand these services.
