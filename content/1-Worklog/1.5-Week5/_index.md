### Week 5 Achievements:

* Reinforced and enhanced practical skills through labs on data storage and management:
  *   Completed Lab 24, gaining a solid understanding of implementing a hybrid cloud storage solution with **AWS Storage Gateway**:
    *   Practiced creating an EC2 instance to serve as the gateway host.
    *   Successfully integrated with an S3 Bucket for data storage.
    *   Learned how to create and configure a File Share.
  *   Completed Labs 19, 20, and 25. However, I honestly don't fully understand them yet, so I plan to redo these labs.

* Continued theoretical learning with Module 4:
  *   Learned an overview of cloud storage services.
  *   Started learning about the S3 service.
    *   Understood the basics of the S3 service and learned about S3 Access Points.

* Contributed to the community:
  *   Completed and submitted a blog translation, contributing to the creation of learning resources for everyone.

*  Honestly, I did not achieve my goal of finishing all of Module 04 and its related labs, but I will strive to complete it in week 6. I will also aim to finish Module 5 during that week to prepare for the midterm exam.
