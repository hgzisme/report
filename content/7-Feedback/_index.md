### General Assessment

**1. Work Environment**
The work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to assist me when I encounter difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is neat and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think some social events or team bonding activities could be added to help everyone understand each other better.

**2. Support from mentor / team admin**
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don't understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The team admin supports procedures, documents, and facilitates my work. I appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems independently instead of just providing answers.

**3. Job relevance to academic major**
The tasks assigned to me are relevant to the knowledge I gained at school, while also expanding into new areas I haven't encountered before. This allows me to both reinforce foundational knowledge and learn practical skills.

**4. Learning & skill development opportunities**
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many practical experiences, helping me better orient my career.

**5. Culture & team spirit**
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still enjoys themselves. When there's an urgent project, everyone works together, providing support regardless of their position. This makes me feel like a part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Policies / benefits for interns**
The company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, participating in internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Other questions
- What are you **most satisfied with** during your internship?
    - What I am most satisfied with during my internship is the dedication of the mentors, who are always ready to support interns, answer questions, and help them devise solutions to problems.
- What do you think the company **needs to improve** for future interns?
    - I think the company needs to improve things like supporting interns with lab exercises. There should be a general announcement for everyone about which sections to study and when those lab exercises will be available, so everyone has better guidance for their learning process. Based on my experience, I felt quite lost when I first started learning. Deadlines were unclear, and some lab exercises required a higher tier than a Free Tier account. I think the company could improve this by scheduling lab exercises for everyone and labeling which labs are not suitable for Free Tier accounts.
- If you were to recommend to friends, would you **advise them to intern here**? Why?
    - If I were to recommend to friends, I would consider two different groups:
        - If they are studying a major related to cybersecurity, this is truly an excellent internship place, as there are many essential cybersecurity services and knowledge that can be learned here.
        - However, if their major is not related to cybersecurity but other fields like software engineering, etc., I would advise them to consider carefully. The networking knowledge here is extensive, and there are many network-related services. In reality, they can still learn, but it will be much slower than those studying cybersecurity. The key is that they must be diligent in their studies to keep up.
        - => Overall, I would encourage everyone to learn here, but they should also consider that this environment demands a very high level of self-study, and interns must be responsible for completing tasks on schedule once they choose to intern.

### Suggestions & aspirations
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?
    - I have no suggestions.
- Do you want to continue this program in the future?
    - I will continue this program in the future.
