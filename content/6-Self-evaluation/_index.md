Throughout my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** from **08/09/2025** to **09/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, train, and apply the knowledge acquired at school to a real-world working environment.
I participated in **building the SnapResume project**, thereby improving my skills in **programming, teamwork, and reasonable time management to complete work on schedule**.

Regarding my work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, adhere to regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues to enhance work efficiency.
