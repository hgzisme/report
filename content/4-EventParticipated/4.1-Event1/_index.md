### Key Learnings

#### On Migration and System Modernization Strategy
- **Proven Roadmaps**: You will learn how to effectively plan and execute a large-scale migration project to AWS, avoiding common pitfalls by drawing on the experience of thousands of previous enterprises.
- **Parallel Modernization**: Grasp the "modernize while you migrate" methodology. Instead of just a "lift-and-shift," you will learn how to refactor applications to fully leverage the power of the cloud from the very beginning.
- **Seamless VMware Migration**: Learn a step-by-step "playbook" to move VMware systems to AWS quickly and safely, minimizing downtime, with a clear roadmap to modernize them into containers (EKS), managed databases (RDS), or serverless architectures.

#### On Applying Generative AI in Software Development
- **Accelerated Programming**: You will watch demos and learn how to use Amazon Q Developer – an AI assistant – to automatically write code, debug, and suggest optimizations, significantly reducing development time.
- **Enhanced Code Quality**: Understand how AI can automatically generate technical documentation and unit tests, making code easier to maintain, more reliable, and less buggy.
- **AI Integration into Workflows**: Learn how to integrate AI tools like Amazon Q into familiar work environments (IDE, CLI), helping development teams work more efficiently without changing their processes.

#### On Comprehensive Cloud Security
- **"Security-by-Design" Mindset**: Learn how to integrate security into every stage of the software development lifecycle (DevSecOps), rather than treating it as a final step.
- **Building a Multi-layered Defense System**: Master AWS's comprehensive security process, from identification, prevention, detection, and response to remediation.
- **Applying AI in Security**: Discover how to use Generative AI to automate the analysis of security threats and accelerate response times, keeping your systems safe from emerging threats.

#### On Practical Experience from Leading Enterprises
- **Multi-industry Perspectives**: Hear directly from technology leaders and experts at Techcombank, OCB, LPBank Securities, and Ninety Eight. You will understand the real challenges they faced and how they leveraged AWS to solve them.
- **Connecting Technology and Business**: Through the panel discussion, you will learn how technology decisions (like application modernization) can directly drive business goals, create a competitive advantage, and accelerate the enterprise's transformation process.

### The Event Experience
