###  [Blog 1 - Streamline Machine Learning Workflows with SkyPilot on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces how to optimize large-scale machine learning workflows by integrating SkyPilot with Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. You will learn how to overcome the complexity of orchestrating Generative AI and Foundation Model tasks by combining HyperPod's resilient infrastructure with SkyPilot’s user-friendly abstraction layer. The article also guides you through the practical steps to deploy the solution, including creating a HyperPod cluster, installing SkyPilot with Kubernetes support, and executing multi-node distributed training tasks using high-performance networking (EFA).

###  [Blog 2 - KINEXON and AWS are Pioneering Player Tracking Technology Tailored for Women’s Sports](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces the groundbreaking collaboration between KINEXON and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in pioneering the development of athlete tracking technology and sports data analytics tailored for women's sports. You will learn about the current reality, where most sports science research is based on male subjects, and how AWS and KINEXON are challenging this status quo by integrating women's unique physiological and biomechanical differences, particularly the menstrual cycle and higher injury risks (e.g., ACL tears), into their technological solutions.

###  [Blog 3 - Advanced Fine-Tuning Methods on Amazon SageMaker AI](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog provides the theoretical foundation and practical insights needed to navigate the complexity of Large Language Model (LLM) development on Amazon SageMaker AI, helping organizations make optimal choices for specific use cases. You will learn about the three fundamental aspects of LLM development: the core lifecycle stages (Pre-training, Continued Pre-training, Fine-tuning), the spectrum of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods (like LoRA, QLoRA) that democratize model customization, and crucial alignment techniques (RLHF, DPO) to ensure responsible AI deployment.
