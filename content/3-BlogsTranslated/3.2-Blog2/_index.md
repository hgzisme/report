Women's sports have often been overlooked when it comes to performance enhancement through sports data analytics.

Recognizing that most research in the field of sports medicine and exercise science, which is the foundation for high-performance training and sports technology, is largely based on male subjects, it is clear that women deserve similar technological advances based on their own studies and findings.

This article describes the collaboration between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and [KINEXON](https://www.kinexon.com/) and our unique approach to player tracking technology tailored for women.

Both AWS and KINEXON are at the forefront of live sports data analytics, and we’ll share how these two companies are collaborating with a common goal—to *challenge the status quo* in women’s sports.

KINEXON is an [AWS Partner](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/0010h00001cCwdWAAS/KINEXON%20GmbH) and a world-leading technology company providing performance and analytics solutions for sports teams and leagues, as well as specialized real-time Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for Industry 4.0.

## Designing Player Tracking Technology Specifically for Women

When customizing player tracking and analytics technology for women, [unique physiological and biomechanical differences between men and women](https://kinexon.com/blog/sports-tech-equality)—such as the menstrual cycle, hormonal fluctuations, physique and body measurements (like a lower center of gravity), and many other factors—must be considered.

KINEXON's expertise in player tracking technology, combined with the power of AWS cloud computing, has paved the way for product adjustments and new advancements in this field.

## Early Technological Advances

One of the key drivers in tailoring sports data analytics to women's needs is understanding and using information about an athlete's menstrual cycle and individual state of health. [Through a daily questionnaire](https://kinexon.com/blog/sports-data-analytics-empowering-women-athletes), it is now possible to combine performance data with personal information and subsequently calculate personalized load recommendations.

Depending on the cycle phase an athlete is currently in, combined with information about her personal health status, the KINEXON application displays a personalized load management plan on a dashboard accessible on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

Load management is a vital concept in sports, as it helps monitor and adjust the intensity of an athlete’s training or competition. The dashboard, shown in Figure 1 below, provides a user-friendly interface for athletes and coaches to track and manage the recommended workload.

This helps prevent injuries while guiding athletes to peak performance. Due to different menstrual cycles and body structures, female athletes have a [sixfold increased risk of serious knee injuries](https://kinexon.com/blog/acl-tears-in-women-athletes) such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. This is one example of why it is time to care about the natural differences between men and women and to pay attention to individual needs.

Another aspect KINEXON and AWS are working on together is establishing more meaningful thresholds for women's sports. In sports technology, performance thresholds are used to automatically detect critical physical events and simplify analysis. Due to the more extensive data collection in men's sports over many years, applying nationally and internationally standard thresholds for men is often easier.

Through many years of KINEXON’s performance tracking with women’s teams, the company has been able to establish distinct thresholds based only on historical data generated by female athletes. This is another part of the new standards KINEXON and AWS are setting.

## Driving Equity in Sports Technology

While celebrating these technological advancements, it is crucial to acknowledge the broader landscape of women in sports. Challenges still abound, such as the lack of resources and unequal opportunities for women in the sports technology field.

To improve the conditions for female athletes and teams in sports, AWS and KINEXON have set three key goals:

  - Listen and Learn
  - Create and Impact
  - Connect and Inform

### Goal \#1 – Listen and Learn

Athletes and coaches know best where untapped potential lies. In women's sports, however, the use of player tracking technology and data analytics is not yet as common for many reasons.

AWS and KINEXON are enabling selected flagship teams—such as former Women’s Champions League participant [TSG Hoffenheim](https://hs.kinexon.com/spo-tsg-hoffenheim-women-case-study), the German pioneer club [Viktoria Berlin](https://kinexon.com/blog/fc-viktoria-to-become-a-kinexon-and-aws-flagship-team), the NCAA women’s basketball team from [Florida State University](https://kinexon.com/blog/florida-state-basketball-next-aws-flagship-womens-team), and the Italian top volleyball team [Savino Del Bene Volley Scandicci](https://kinexon-sports.com/blog/savino-del-bene-scandicci-volleyball-selected-as-third-kinexon-and-aws-flagship-team/)—to use technology that helps them integrate analytics into their daily routine.

For all KINEXON solutions, there are different sensors that athletes wear to track data during practice or games. These sensors can be worn in a female-specific vest or by using a sensor pocket that the athlete can attach to her personal sports bra, as shown in Figure 2.

*Figure 2 – Athlete attaching the KINEXON sensor for data logging.*

KINEXON's sports science and technology consultants work closely with the teams, engaging in personal interactions and collaborations. Their goal is to implement cutting-edge technology, determine meaningful metrics through thorough discussions, and create personalized and comprehensive reports.

Ultimately, they empower the coaches and teams to use data effectively while providing the necessary insights based on objective athlete information. In turn, the clubs and sports teams learn about the needs and potential of the athletes. This approach ensures female athletes and their teams are actively involved in the development and improvement of sports technology solutions.

Below, Figure 3 shows KINEXON's GNSS solution, including the docking station and sensors. The athletes can easily grab the sensor and place it into their pocket before the session starts. All sensors can be switched on and off right at the docking station. The docking station can also be used to charge the sensors; for instance, while traveling.

### Goal \#2 – Create and Impact

Ideas and insights from flagship teams and women’s teams globally are just the beginning. Through our collaboration, AWS and KINEXON closely monitor the requests of women's sports teams and check their feasibility, and jointly develop effective, achievable solutions to create measurable impact.

Another innovation makes load management even easier, more flexible, and more customizable—even cycle-oriented. The first [female-specific load management dashboards](https://kinexon.com/solutions/sports-analytics-for-women-athletes#results) from AWS and KINEXON are based on the athlete’s menstrual cycle and health status. In addition, the newly developed [cycle-oriented load planner](https://kinexon.com/blog/menstrual-cycle-oriented-performance-training-in-womens-sports) can be used by any team in just five simple steps.

These features come with all KINEXON player tracking solutions, running on the AWS platform and applicable for both indoor and outdoor environments.

The new cycle-oriented dashboards are capable of:

  - Combining individual feedback on symptoms, cycle phase, and planned workload.
  - Allowing each coach to customize their dashboard to monitor the metrics they value most in each session.

The load planning makes it possible to combine cycle data and training control, and provides coaches and athletes with a simple/clear overview.

### Goal \#3 – Connect and Inform

Sharing experiences and knowledge can help any team, which is why we value and promote the open sharing of information, current studies, and knowledge. AWS and KINEXON actively seek and encourage exchange, always striving to contribute to the professionalization of women's sports. We are committed to building a supportive community where knowledge is shared and progress is made.
