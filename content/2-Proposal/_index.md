# SnapResume Platform

## 1\. Project Summary

SnapResume is an intelligent, AI-powered resume-building platform designed to help job seekers create professional, ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compliant resumes quickly and efficiently. The platform offers modern design templates, intuitive editing tools, and a smart recommendation system that optimizes content to match job descriptions.

The key differentiator is the integration of an AI Search & Recommendation Engine using **AWS Bedrock** (Claude 3 Sonnet). This allows the system to automatically analyze job descriptions and suggest the most relevant resume sections from the user's experience data repository. The system is built entirely on a Serverless architecture, ensuring infinite scalability and optimized costs.

## 2\. Problem Statement

### What is the problem?

  * **Formatting Difficulties:** Job seekers often spend hours formatting text in Word or complex design tools without achieving a professional look.
  * **Difficulty in Selecting Information:** Candidates often have extensive experience but struggle to select what is most relevant to a specific position. Sending a "generic" CV to every company reduces the chance of acceptance.
  * **ATS Rejection:** Manually designed resumes often contain graphic elements or table structures that make them unreadable to employers' automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

### The Solution

SnapResume addresses these issues with a modern React web application built on the AWS Serverless platform.

  * **Visual Editor:** Simple drag-and-drop or form-filling interface with Real-time Preview.
  * **AI Smart Matcher:** Uses **AWS Bedrock** to analyze the relevance between the candidate's experience and job requirements, thereby recommending a list of skills and projects to include in the CV.
  * **ATS Compliant:** Templates are designed to be machine-friendly while remaining aesthetically pleasing for human readers.
  * **Centralized Management:** Stores a library of sections and allows for "assembling" multiple resume versions based on specific needs.

## 3\. Solution Architecture

The system utilizes Serverless and Event-driven architecture on AWS.

### Architecture Overview

  * **Frontend:** React + Vite + Ant Design (hosted on Amplify and accelerated via CloudFront).
  * **API Layer:** Amazon API Gateway + AWS Lambda (Node.js/TypeScript).
  * **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB for storing Users, Resumes, Sections, and Templates.
  * **Authentication:** Amazon Cognito (User Pools & Identity Pools).
  * **AI Engine:** Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) for analysis and recommendation tasks.
  * **Storage:** Amazon S3 for storing profile pictures and PDF files.

## 4\. Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

  * **Frontend:** ReactJS, Ant Design, CSS Modules, html2pdf.js for PDF export.
  * **Backend:** NodeJS, TypeScript, Express (running inside Lambda).
  * **IaC:** Terraform for managing the entire infrastructure.

### Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Core Foundation** (Completed)
      * Setup AWS Infrastructure (Terraform).
      * Build Authentication (Cognito).
      * Basic CRUD for Resumes & Sections (DynamoDB + Lambda).
2.  **Phase 2: Editor & Templates** (Completed)
      * Develop Universal Editor Interface (Extension/Web).
      * Build Dynamic Template System.
      * PDF Export Feature (html2pdf.js).
3.  **Phase 3: AI Integration & Polish** (In Progress)
      * Integrate Amazon Bedrock for "AI Recommendation" feature.
      * Optimize UX/UI (Features Page, Editor Flow).
      * Extension Integration (Web Clipper flow).

## 5\. Budget Estimate (AWS Costs)

The Serverless pricing model ensures costs are proportional to usage. AI costs are focused on analyzing large input data (Input Tokens).

### AI Cost Assumptions

The estimated costs for the Amazon Bedrock service (utilizing the Claude 3 Sonnet model) are calculated based on the following *real-world usage scenario* (MVP):

#### 1. Usage Frequency & Volume

1.  **Processing Rate**: The system processes an average of 1 request per minute (1 request/minute).
2.  **Operating Time**: The system is expected to be under high load or actively used for 2 hours/day (120 minutes/day).
3.  **Total Monthly Volume**: 120 requests/day × 30 days = 3,600 requests/month.

#### 2. Data Size (Token Size) per Request

1.  **Input (Input Tokens)**: Average of 500 tokens/request.
    *   Includes: Data extracted from the user's current CV and the content of the Job Description to be analyzed.
2.  **Output (Output Tokens)**: Average of 600 tokens/request.
    *   Includes: Analysis results, editing suggestions, and data returned in structured JSON format.

#### 3. Unit Pricing (Pricing - Claude 3 Sonnet)

*   **Input**: $0.003 / 1,000 tokens (equivalent to $3.00 / 1 million tokens).
*   **Output**: $0.015 / 1,000 tokens (equivalent to $15.00 / 1 million tokens).

#### AI Cost Breakdown

*   Total Monthly Volume = Frequency * Duration * 30 days
*   Input Token Cost = Total Monthly Volume * Input Tokens per Request * ($3 / 1 million tokens)
*   Output Token Cost = Total Monthly Volume * Output Tokens per Request * ($15 / 1 million tokens)
*   Total Cost = Input Token Cost + Output Token Cost

##### Low traffic
*   Processing Rate: 1 request/minute
*   Operating Time: 2 hours/day

##### High traffic
*   Processing Rate: 2 request/minute
*   Operating Time: 3 hours/day


| Service | Pricing Model | Low Traffic (MVP) | Medium Traffic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Amazon S3 | Storage | $0.28 | $0.77 |
| CloudFront | CDN | Free Tier | Free Tier |
| API GW + Lambda | Compute | Free Tier | $2.80 |
| DynamoDB | Database | Free Tier | $6.25 |
| Cognito | Auth | Free Tier | Free Tier |
| Amazon Bedrock (AI) | Tokens | $37.8 | $113.4 |
| WAF + Route53 | Security | $12.60 | $12.60 |
| **Total Cost / Month** | | **\~ $50.68** | **\~ $135.82** |

## 6\. Risk Assessment

### Security & Privacy Risks (High)

  * **Issue:** The Recommendation feature requires sending the user's entire Section data to Bedrock for analysis.
  * **Mitigation:**
      * AWS Bedrock complies with regulations ensuring customer data is not used to train base models.
      * Data encryption at rest in DynamoDB.

### Cost Risks (Medium)

  * **Issue:** Users spamming the "Recommend" button with long Job Descriptions causing high Input Token usage.
  * **Mitigation:**
      * Limit the length of Job Description Input.
      * Implement Quota limits (e.g., 10 analysis calls/day for Free accounts).

### Architectural Risks (Low)

  * **Issue:** Lambda cold starts slowing down the initial user experience.
  * **Mitigation:** Use Lambda SnapStart (for Java) or Provisioned Concurrency if necessary (though Node.js cold starts are generally quite fast).

## 7\. Expected Outcomes

  * Ownership of a complete SaaS platform for the recruitment market.
  * Solving the "Matching" problem between candidates and jobs, rather than being just a pure text editing tool.
  * Leveraging AWS AI power to create real value (Smart Search) instead of generic "writing assistance" features.
