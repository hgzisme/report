# S3 Static Website & CloudFront Hosting System

In this workshop, we will build a static website hosting and delivery system using **Amazon S3** and **Amazon CloudFront**.

#### System Architecture
The system consists of the following key components:
1.  **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Stores website source code (HTML, CSS, JS, Images). Configured with **Static Website Hosting** feature.
2.  **Amazon CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) to accelerate website access for global users and reduce load on S3.
3.  **Security**: Access management via **Block Public Access** and **Bucket Policies/ACLs**.
